# Silence .gitkeep in coursework/, sandbox/, and submitted/
# export-ignore: skips .gitkeep when creating archive exports (git archive)
# linguist-generated: tells GitHub to treat it as auto-generated (wonâ€™t count toward language stats)
# -text: disables line-ending normalization (avoids diffs on CRLF vs LF)
# export-ignore: exclude from git archive, although empty folders remain visible on github
