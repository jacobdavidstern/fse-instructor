# Major Project #3

# React State Management Application - Assessment Rubric v2

## Project Overview

This rubric evaluates the React State Management Application based on React hooks, Context API, and immutable state patterns covered in modules 063-069. Students will build a comprehensive React application demonstrating proficiency with useState, useEffect, Context API, and immutable state updates. Advanced patterns like useReducer and Redux Toolkit are optional bonus features.

### Project Options

**Option A: Personal Library App**
An app for managing books or movies, favorites, and if they have been viewed or read. Will utilize routing, hooks, and localstorage! Integrates one or more APIs.

**Option B: Mini Game**
Design an interactive game like memory or tic-tac-toe using React components, hooks for state management, routing between levels or screens, and local storage for saving player progress. Integrates one or more APIs.

## **Must Have (Required for Passing):**

### **React Fundamentals**

- [x] **useState Hook** - Manage local component state effectively
- [x] **useEffect Hook** - Handle side effects, API calls, and component lifecycle
- [x] **Custom Hooks** - Create at least one reusable custom hook that encapsulates logic

### **Context API & Global State**

- [x] **Context Provider Setup** - Create and configure Context providers for application-wide state (theme, user preferences, or app data)
- [x] **useContext Implementation** - Consume context values across multiple components
- [x] **State Lifting** - Properly lift and share state between components

### **Immutable State Updates**

- [x] **Object Updates** - Update object state immutably using spread operator
- [x] **Nested Object Updates** - Handle nested object updates while maintaining immutability
- [x] **Array Operations** - Add, remove, and update array items using immutable methods (map, filter, etc.)
- [x] **Functional Updates** - Use functional state updates when depending on previous state

### **Core Application Features**

- [x] **API Integration** - Fetch and manage data from external APIs
- [x] **React Router** - Implement multi-page navigation with at least 3 routes
- [x] **LocalStorage Integration** - Persist user data and preferences using localStorage
- [x] **Error Handling** - Implement try/catch blocks, loading states, and user-friendly error messages

### **Component Organization & Best Practices**

- [x] **Component Structure** - Well-organized components with single responsibility
- [x] **Props Management** - Proper prop passing and prop validation
- [x] **Event Handling** - Clean event handler implementation with proper binding

### **Project Standards**

- [x] **Clean Repository** - Meaningful commits and organized folder structure
- [x] **README Documentation** - Setup instructions, features list, and API documentation
- [x] **Live Deployment** - Working deployed version accessible via URL
- [x] **Component Architecture** - Well-structured components following React best practices

## **Advanced Features (Bonus Points):**

### **Redux Toolkit Implementation** (Optional)

- [ ] Store Configuration - Set up Redux store using configureStore() with proper middleware
- [ ] Slice Creation - Create Redux slices using createSlice() for different feature areas
- [ ] useSelector/useDispatch - Use hooks to access state and dispatch actions with proper action creators
- [ ] Async State Management - Handle async operations using Redux Thunk for API calls
- [ ] Redux DevTools - Set up and use Redux DevTools for debugging state changes

### **useReducer Implementation** (Optional)

- [ ] Complex State Management - Use useReducer for managing complex state objects with multiple related values
- [ ] Pure Reducer Functions - Write proper reducer functions that handle different action types

### **Performance Optimization**

- [ ] Code Splitting - Implement React.lazy and Suspense for route-level code splitting
- [ ] Context Optimization - Optimize Context API usage to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Component Memoization - Use React.memo, useMemo, or useCallback appropriately

### **Advanced Patterns**

- [ ] Error Boundaries - Add error boundaries to handle component errors gracefully
- [ ] Loading States - Implement comprehensive loading and error states throughout the app

## **Project-Specific Requirements**

### **Option A - Personal Library App Must Include:**

- [ ] CRUD Operations - Add, edit, delete, and search for books/movies with state management
- [ ] Favorites System - Mark items as favorites with persistent state management
- [ ] Status Tracking - Track read/unread or watched/unwatched status
- [ ] Advanced Filtering - Filter and sort library by status, genre, rating, or other criteria

### **Option B - Mini Game Must Include:**

- [x] **Game Logic** - Core game mechanics (memory matching, tic-tac-toe moves, etc.) managed through state
- [x] **Player Progress** - Save game progress, scores, and achievements using state management
- [x] **Multi-Screen Navigation** - Navigate between game levels, menus, settings, and game screens
- [x] **Interactive Components** - Reusable game components (cards, board tiles, buttons) with proper event handling
