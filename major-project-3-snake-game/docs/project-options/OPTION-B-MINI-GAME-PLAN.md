# Option B: Mini Game Development Plan

## Project Overview

Build an interactive mini-game using React Router for navigation between game screens, Context API and React hooks for managing game state, and integration with one or more external APIs. Examples include: quiz game with trivia API, memory match with image API, typing game with quote API, or word guessing game with dictionary API.

## Important: Project Structure Connection

**CRITICAL:** Your game needs proper folder organization:

```
src/
├── context/
│   ├── GameContext.jsx       # Game state context provider
│   └── PlayerContext.jsx     # Player data context
├── hooks/
│   ├── useLocalStorage.js    # Custom hook for localStorage
│   ├── useGame.js            # Custom hook for game operations
│   └── useTimer.js           # Custom hook for game timer
├── pages/
│   ├── Home.jsx              # Welcome screen
│   ├── Game.jsx              # Main game screen
│   ├── GameOver.jsx          # Game over screen
│   └── Leaderboard.jsx       # High scores
├── components/
│   ├── Navigation.jsx        # App navigation
│   ├── GameBoard.jsx         # Main game component
│   ├── ScoreDisplay.jsx      # Score and stats
│   └── Timer.jsx             # Game timer (if needed)
├── App.jsx                   # Routes and context providers
└── main.jsx                  # App entry point
```

## Essential State Variables

**IMPORTANT:** Your game needs to track state with Context API and useState. Plan these structures:

**Game Context State:**

- score: Current score number
- level: Current level/difficulty
- gameStatus: String ("idle", "playing", "paused", "gameOver")
- timeRemaining: Time left in seconds (if timed game)

**Player Context State:**

- playerName: String username
- highScores: Array of score objects
- gamesPlayed: Total games counter

**Game-Specific State (varies by game type):**
For Quiz: questions array, currentQuestion index, selectedAnswer, correctAnswers count
For Memory: cards array, flippedCards array, matchedPairs counter
For Typing: targetText string, userInput string, wordsPerMinute number
For Snake: snakePosition array, foodPosition object, direction string

## Core Functionality Requirements

### 1. Context API Setup & State Lifting

- Create GameContext with createContext
- Build GameProvider component with useState for game state

- Respond to user actions immediately
- Provide visual feedback for actions
- Play sound effects (optional)
- Show animations for game events

## Development Strategy

3. Set up folder structure with context/ and hooks/ folders
4. Create basic page components
5. Set up routing
6. Test navigation works

### Phase 2: Context API & State Setup

3. Add high score tracking
4. Create leaderboard page
5. Add CSS styling
6. Add sound effects (optional)

## Component Organization Best Practices

### Component Structure

- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Separate game logic from presentation components
- Extract reusable game elements into components
- Use clear, descriptive component names

### Props Management

- Define expected props clearly
- Use prop destructuring for readability
- Pass only necessary props to child components
- Avoid prop drilling by using Context

### Event Handling

- Use descriptive handler names (handleKeyPress, handleCardFlip)
- Keep handlers in the component that owns the state
- Use functional updates for state that depends on previous value
- Clean up event listeners in useEffect

## Key React Hooks & Methods You'll Use

**React Hooks:**

- useState() - Local game state
- useEffect() - Game loop, timers, cleanup
- useContext() - Consume game/player context
- useRef() - Track previous values, intervals
- useCallback() - Optimize event handlers (optional)

**React Router:**

- BrowserRouter - Enable routing
- Routes and Route - Define game screens
- Link / NavLink - Navigation
- useNavigate() - Programmatic navigation (go to game over)
- useLocation() - Access passed state (score data)

**Context API:**

- createContext() - Create context objects
- Context.Provider - Provide values to component tree
- useContext() - Consume context in components

**Immutable Updates:**

- Spread operator (...) - Copy objects/arrays
- Array.map() - Transform array items
- Array.filter() - Remove items
- Array.concat() / [...arr, item] - Add items

**Game Logic:**

- setInterval() / setTimeout() - Timers
- addEventListener() - Keyboard/mouse input
- Math.random() - Random game elements
- Date.now() - Timestamp for scoring
- localStorage - Persist high scores

## Testing Your Functions

### Method 1: Chrome Developer Tools

Open DevTools (F12) and test:

**Check Context State:**

- Use React DevTools extension
- Inspect component tree
- View context values
- Watch state changes during gameplay

**Check Game Logic:**

- Console.log user inputs
- Verify score calculations
- Test win/lose detection
- Monitor timer accuracy

**Check LocalStorage:**

- Open Application tab
- View localStorage entries
- Verify scores save correctly
- Test loading on refresh

### Method 2: Interactive Testing

Play the game and test:

- Start game from home screen
- Play through complete game
- Verify score increases correctly
- Test pause functionality
- Reach game over condition
- Check high score saves
- View leaderboard
- Play multiple rounds

### Method 3: Edge Case Testing

Test unusual scenarios:

- Spam click/keypress rapidly
- Pause and unpause repeatedly
- Navigate away mid-game (back button)
- Try to start multiple games simultaneously
- Test with very high scores
- Test localStorage when empty
- Refresh page mid-game

## Debugging Tips

1. **Context Not Working**: Ensure component is wrapped in Provider
2. **Timer Issues**: Clear intervals on component unmount with useEffect cleanup
3. **Input Lag**: Use useCallback for event handlers to optimize performance
4. **State Not Updating**: Ensure you're not mutating state directly
5. **Score Not Saving**: Check localStorage in Application tab of DevTools
6. **Navigation Problems**: Verify you're using navigate() correctly

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Not wrapping app with Provider**: Context won't work without Provider
2. **Not clearing intervals**: Always cleanup timers in useEffect return function
3. **Multiple event listeners**: Remove listeners on unmount to prevent memory leaks
4. **Direct state mutation**: Always create new objects/arrays with spread operator
5. **Forgetting functional updates**: Use setState(prev => ...) for timers/scores
6. **Forgetting to persist**: Save high scores to localStorage after each game
7. **Hardcoding game data**: Use configuration objects for easy tweaking
8. **No loading state**: Show feedback while game initializes
