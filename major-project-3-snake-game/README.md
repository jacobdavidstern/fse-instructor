# 🐍 Snake Game (React)

A modern React take on the classic Snake arcade game.

Move, eat, grow, survive collisions and the timer, and get a random quote on Game Over.

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay
- 3‑minute countdown timer
- Game Over screen with a random quote from Advice Slip API (Quotable didn't deploy)
- Persistent Score tracking in LocalStorage
- React Router multi‑page flow: Home, Game, Game Over
- Leaderboard available on Home and Game Over page with name entry and Anonymous default
- Custom hooks (useTimer, useGameContext, useQuote)
- Score and remaining time displayed on Game page

## External API

This project uses the Advice Slip API to fetch a random quote on the Game Over screen.

If the API request fails, a console error is generated and a fallback message shown.
