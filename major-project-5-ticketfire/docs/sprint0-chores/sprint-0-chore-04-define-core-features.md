# Chore 4: Define Core Features and MVP

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

## Task
Identify MVP features, prioritize them, and write clear MVP description

## Steps

### Part 1: Core Features (MVP vs Nice-to-Have)
- [ ] Brainstorm ALL possible features you could build
- [ ] For EACH feature, ask: "If this feature was missing, would my users still get value from the app?"
  - If YES → Nice-to-Have
  - If NO → MVP Feature
- [ ] Label 3-5 features as **MVP Features** (must have for launch)
- [ ] Label all other features as **Nice-to-Have** or **Future Enhancement**
- [ ] Verify MVP features can be built in 2-3 weeks
- [ ] Create features list in a document or README with clear labels

**Example:**
```
MVP Features (Must Have):
- User registration and login
- Create new task
- View task list
- Mark task as complete
- Delete task

Nice-to-Have Features (Future):
- Task categories/tags
- Due dates and reminders
- Task priority levels
- Share tasks with other users
- Dark mode
```

### Part 2: Define MVP
- [ ] Write 2-3 sentence MVP description
- [ ] Example: "Users can register, login, create tasks, mark them complete, and view their task list. That's it."
- [ ] Verify: "Can a user get value from JUST these core features?" (Must be YES)
- [ ] Document MVP in README or planning doc
- [ ] Get instructor approval on MVP scope

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete feature list created with clear labels
- [ ] 3-5 core MVP features identified and labeled as "MVP Features"
- [ ] Non-essential features clearly labeled as "Nice-to-Have"
- [ ] Each feature passes the test: "Would users still get value without this?"
- [ ] MVP features are realistic for 2-3 week timeline
- [ ] MVP description written (2-3 sentences)
- [ ] MVP provides clear user value
- [ ] Scope is realistic for 2-3 weeks
- [ ] Instructor approved MVP
