## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to get 10 users?**
A: No, minimum is 1 real user (can be you). But it should be feasible to get 10 if needed.

**Q: Can I work with a partner?**
A: Yes, just make sure the scope is large enough that you both can do full stack work.

**Q: Does my instructor count as a user?**
A: No, the user should be someone who genuinely needs the app.

**Q: Can all my users be friends/family?**
A: Yes, if they genuinely use the app. No, if they're just helping you pass.

**Q: What if my idea is too big?**
A: Start with MVP (minimum viable product). Ship simple version first, add features later.

**Q: What if my project is supposed to be local only?**
A: That isn't a problem. In that case you will probably want to use SQLite and Sequelize for your project and skip deployment. Ask your instructor if it makes sense for your project.

**Q: How do I find a good project idea?**
A: Read the [Project Idea and User Discovery Guide](project-idea-and-user-discovery.md) for strategies on identifying pain points, validating ideas, and finding your first users.
