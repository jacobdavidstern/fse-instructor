# Task Management API

A secure REST API for managing personal tasks with user authentication, role‑based access, and MongoDB persistence

## Overview

This project is a backend‑only API built with Node.js, Express, JWT authentication, and MongoDB/Mongoose.
Users can register, log in, and manage their own tasks. Admin users have elevated permissions to view all tasks across the system.

This was built as Major Project 4 in my full‑stack program.

### Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- helmet, CORS, rate limiting for security
- dotenv for environment configuration

### Features

#### Core Features (Required)

- User registration & login
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT‑based authentication
- Authentication middleware
- Role‑based access control (user vs admin)
- Task CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Ownership verification (users can only modify their tasks)
- Admin route to view all tasks
- Input validation
- Global error handling
- Security middleware (helmet, CORS, rate limiting)

#### Bonus Features Completed

MongoDB Integration

- Replaced in‑memory arrays with persistent Mongoose models
- User and Task schemas implemented
- Database connection via environment variables

#### Bonus Features Not Implemented

- Left out intentionally to keep scope focused
- Single‑task GET endpoint
- Admin user management
- Filtering, sorting, pagination
- Search
- Refresh tokens
- Password reset
- Automated tests

### Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jacobdavidstern/fse-instructor.git
cd major-project-4-task-management-api
```

2. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

3. Create .env file

```sh
PORT=3001
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

4. Start the server

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Testing

You can test the API using:

- Postman (tested)
- Thunder Client (VS Code)
- curl

#### Authentication requires sending a JWT in the Authorization header:

`Authorization: Bearer <token>`
